Build from source
--------------

In order to build your ProcessingJS project from its source, you will also need Grunt. To install Grunt globally on the command line (and run the above build task), run:

```
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

Once you have generated your ProcessingJS project's skeleton, you can build the minified files, the documentation and the example with Grunt:

```
grunt build
```
